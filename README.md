# Website-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes website performance by examining user traffic, engagement metrics, channel effectiveness, and predicting future traffic patterns. Using a comprehensive dataset, I transformed, aggregated, and visualized metrics to gain a holistic view of website interactions over time.

# Session Analysis: Tracking Traffic Trends
Data Preparation: Loaded raw data, parsed date columns, and converted user and session counts to numeric format for accurate analysis.
Traffic Visualization: Aggregated user and session data by date and hour to reveal trends in website activity. This enabled a clear view of peak and off-peak hours for user visits.
Visualization: Plotted total users and sessions over time to provide insight into overall traffic flow.

# User Engagement Analysis: Gauging User Interaction Depth
Metric Conversion: Converted engagement-related columns such as engaged sessions, average engagement time per session, and engagement rate into numeric formats.
Aggregation & Visualization: Calculated mean engagement metrics for each hourly interval, including average session duration, engaged sessions per user, events per session, and engagement rate.
Correlation Analysis: Plotted scatter matrices to explore relationships between engagement time, engagement rate, events per session, and engaged sessions per user. This provided a nuanced understanding of how users interact with the site and which factors drive deeper engagement.

# Channel Performance: Evaluating Channel Effectiveness
Channel Aggregation: Grouped data by primary channel and calculated key metrics, including user and session counts, total engaged sessions, average engagement rate, and events per session.
Normalization & Visualization: Normalized engagement rate and events per session for each channel, allowing for a fair comparison. The bar charts helped identify the most effective channels in terms of user acquisition and engagement.

# Website Traffic Forecasting: Predicting Future Traffic Patterns
Seasonality & Differencing: Applied seasonality analysis to account for 24-hour cycles in user sessions, with ACF and PACF plots to determine model order.
SARIMA Model for Forecasting: Used a SARIMA model with hourly data frequency to forecast sessions over the next 24 hours. By fitting the model to recent historical data, the project produced an hourly forecast that highlights expected traffic volumes.
Forecast Visualization: Displayed forecasted session values alongside actual data, illustrating expected traffic patterns and potential peaks in demand.
